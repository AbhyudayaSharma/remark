# Plugins

**remark** plugins lie at the core of **remark**‚Äôs vision. As they operate on
the same syntax tree, there is no start-up time penalty when using more than
one plug-in: something which traditional tools, which need to re-compile
to markdown to connect together need.

See [tools built with remark ¬ª](https://github.com/wooorm/remark/blob/master/doc/products.md).

## Using plugins

See [**remarkplugin**(7)](https://github.com/wooorm/remark/blob/master/doc/remarkplugin.7.md)
for more information on using plugins.

## Creating plugins

See [**remarkplugin**(3)](https://github.com/wooorm/remark/blob/master/doc/remarkplugin.3.md)
for more information on creating plugins.

## Publishing plugins

It is recommended to publish a plugin as an
[npm module](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/publishing-npm-packages).

You should pick a name prefixed by `"remark-"`, valid examples are
[**remark-toc**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-toc) or
[**remark-yaml-config**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-yaml-config).
The reasoning here is that they can be used on the CLI without this prefix,
but can still be meaningful. For example, `lint` was not available, but instead
of opting for `liiint` or some other weird form, using `remark-lint` ensured a
unique name on package managers, while still being meaningful to users.

Additionally, when the library could be used in the browser, I recommend
publishing at least to [Component](https://github.com/componentjs/guide/blob/master/creating-components/publishing.md).
This will also make a package usable by [Duo](https://github.com/duojs/duo).

When publishing a plugin, you should utilize the package manager‚Äôs keywords
functionality and include `"remark"` in the list.

## Renaming from _mdast_ to _remark_

First of all, thanks for taking the time to work with me on this. üëç
I definitely value the time you put into the name-change.  A lot.

Here are some tips for the change:

*   I suggest upping to a new major release, released with the new name.  In
    the case of `mdast-foo@1.2.1`, that would go to `remark-foo@2.0.0`.
    That updated version should depend and work with, as it name suggests,
    **remark**.

*   Then, create a near-empty project with a `readme.md` (pointing to to
    `remark-html` on GitHub or npm), and a deprecation notice, and publish it
    as `mdast-foo@2.0.0` (yes, a major bump too).

*   Use `npm deprecate mdast-foo@2.0.0 'Renamed to`remark-foo`'`, with
    some additional information if needed.

That would ensure no users get any deprecation notices normally, but if they
are in the process of updating their dependencies, they‚Äôll get one and
hopefully rename their dependency. üòÑ
