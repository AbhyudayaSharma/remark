Setting `commonmark: true` (default: `true`) enables:

- Stricter paragraph parsing, which causes indentation following a paragraph, which normally would be seen as code, to be part of the preceding paragraph;
- Stricter ATX-heading parsing (`# hash-headings`), which requires spacing after initial hashes, and before closing hashes.
