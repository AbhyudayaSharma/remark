Setting `pedantic: true` (default: `false`):

*   Adds support for emphasis and strongness, with underscores (`_`), inside
    words;

*   Adds support for different list bullets (`*`, `-`, `+`) for the same list
    (when in `commonmark: true` mode, the same goes for both ordered list
    delimiters: `.` and `)`);

*   Removes less spaces in list-items (a maximum of four instead of the whole
    indent).
